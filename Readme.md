and extracts useful information without analyzing the file system or file system structures. 
The tool is very powerful in creating Wordlists from unencrypted evidence from a target person.

passphrases of a target person based on inputs, e.g. the nickname, name of the pet or the child's 
date of birth. It is based on the assumption that many passwords are a combination of passphrases, 
numbers, and special characters.

external links, and returns a list of words which can then be used for password crackers such as Hashcat.
